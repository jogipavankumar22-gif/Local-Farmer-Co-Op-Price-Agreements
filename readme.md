# Local Farmer Co-Op Price Agreements

## Project Description

A blockchain-based smart contract system implemented by farmers' cooperatives (Co-Op) to revolutionize agricultural trade through transparent pricing mechanisms. The system ensures fair pricing for farmers by setting minimum guaranteed prices for each crop type, preventing buyers from purchasing below these thresholds. All transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger, providing transparency and accountability for farmers, buyers, and regulatory bodies. The smart contract automates payment release to farmers upon delivery confirmation, effectively eliminating middleman interference and ensuring direct, fair compensation.

## Project Vision

To create a decentralized, transparent, and fair agricultural marketplace that empowers farmers through guaranteed minimum pricing while building trust between all stakeholders in the agricultural supply chain. Our vision is to eliminate exploitation in agricultural trade, ensure food security through fair compensation to farmers, and create a sustainable ecosystem where technology serves the farming community's best interests.
